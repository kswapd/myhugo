# Difference between `SynchronousQueue` ,  `LinkedBlockingQueue`, `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`.

the SynchronousQueue is more of a handoff, whereas the LinkedBlockingQueue just allows a single element. The difference being that the put() call to a SynchronousQueue will not return until there is a corresponding take() call, but with a LinkedBlockingQueue of size 1, the put() call (to an empty queue) will return immediately.

I can't say that i have ever used the SynchronousQueue directly myself, but it is the default BlockingQueue used for the Executors.newCachedThreadPool() methods. It's essentially the BlockingQueue implementation for when you don't really want a queue (you don't want to maintain any pending data).


```.java
public static ExecutorService newCachedThreadPool() {
    return new ThreadPoolExecutor(0, Integer.MAX_VALUE, 60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS,
      new SynchronousQueue<Runnable>());
}


public static ExecutorService newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads) {
    return new ThreadPoolExecutor(nThreads, nThreads, 0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, 
      new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>());
}
```


LinkedBlockingQueue is a blocking queue. So, it blocks the accessing threads when the queue is empty.  It implements its locking based on two-lock queue algorithm

ConcurrentLinkedQueue does not block the accessing thread when the queue is empty and returns null. It relies on the Michael & Scott algorithm for non-blocking, lock-free queues.
